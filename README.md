![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)  A blood donation system which provides end to end traceability through web and mobile ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)
 
 :hospital:

### Synopsis:
Blockchain-based blood donation system: A unique way to trace blood and add accountability to the ecosystem by:
- Enabling digital signing of donated blood bottles by an authorised donation center
- Tracing and signing a pint of blood by the testing center

(*unique feature- The testing center can digitally sign by using a basic QR code readable camera phone and verify the quality of blood received*)
- Empowering the health center (and therefore, the consumer of the blood) to track the history of blood and utilize it

### Motivation:

> Human blood is invaluable. It can not be manufactured like electronic devices and there is no substitute to it. 

Every 2 seconds, someone in the US needs blood. Even though, we **DONATE** blood, the industry in itself holds a market of a massive $ 4.5 billion USD annually in the US. [ [Forbes] ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2012/06/27/blood-money-the-guys-who-trade-your-blood-for-profit/#27d29e7282e2) 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Unfortunately, there have been cases of innocuous and malicious blood donation, which has led to diseases like HIV AIDS and Syphilis to patients accepting blood from donors. :heavy_exclamation_mark: 


-In the early 1990s, America's industry leader in blood supply, *Red Cross closed its center in Washington DC after it was discovered that 235 people who had received blood from their donors tested positive for HIV AIDS virus.* [ [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/07/business/all-about-blood-banks-a-multibillion-dollar-business-in-a-nonprofit-world.html?pagewanted=all) ] 

-In 2008, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) uncovered 3 cases in Colorado where patients received contaminated blood which caused AIDS.
[ [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5941a3.htm) ]

-This number is miniscule compared to such cases happening in developing countries like India. [ [Science Alert:2000 cases in India](https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-transfusions-have-given-hiv-to-more-than-2-000-people-in-india) ]

#### Most importantly, we are developing a new diverse industry by facilitating blood donation in an accountable and transparent way from developing countries in rare medical conditions such as [ [Haiti gets blood from Italy, South Africa and USA: RedCross](http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Red-Cross-Working-across-Borders-to-Ensure-Haitis-Blood-Supply) ] [ [Blood test/supply internationally between Geneva and Paris](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-most-precious-blood-on-earth/381911/) ]

### Technologies:
Solidity, React-redux, uPort API, react

### USP of our project/novelty:

- We are providing transparency and tracebility in an inexpensive way. The Donation Center, Testing Center and Health Center need a uPort application in their smart phones to digitally sign a contract/attest quality of blood.

- Moreover, we have generated QR code labels for bottles/pints of blood which can be just read by a simple camera and taken directly to authentication page. Note: No web-app will be required if the testing and health center go with this route. This kind of a mechanism hasn't been implemented before.
